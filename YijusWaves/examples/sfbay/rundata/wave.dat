wind_dt                 360     # Time step for wind data input (sec).
implicit_whitecap       1       # 1: semi-implicit scheme to solve white capping; 0: explicit scheme to solve white capping
implicit_advection      1       # 1: implicit scheme to solve transport in geographic space; 0: explicit scheme
wind_forcing	        1       # 1: wind forcing; 0: no wind, then some BC for waves might be needed, otherwise there is no wave
nstation                5       # Number of wind stations
tail_opt                0       # 1: A tail of f^{-tail_pow} is added in the spectrum (based on Booij et al, 1999); 0: no tail is added
tail_pow                5       # Power for the tail of the action density (sigma_max^tail_pow). It is usually set 4 or 5
wind_shear              1       # 1: If the wind data that is used for waves is also used as the shear stress on the water surface; 0: no wind shear is applied
rad_stress              1       # 1: If the hydrodynamics is coupled with waves through the radiation stress; 0: no feadback of waves to hydrodynamics
form_drag               0       # 1: If the form drag model that parameterizes the friction induced by small bed forms is applied; 0: no bedform-induced friction 
btm_mud                 1       # 1: If the two-layer mud model (by Ng, Coastal Eng 2000) is applied to model bottom dissipation; 0: no mud
btm_sedi_erosion        0       # 1: Mud thickness in mud dissipation model is obtained based on sediment pickup; 0: fixed value of "btm_mud_thickness" is used
depth_fw_cutoff         1       # In case that the bottom drag induced dissipation is not sufficient in very shallow regions, this sets a cutoff depth (in m), below which a big constant fw is used 
fw_drag                 0.2     # Following the previous one, this is the value set for strong bottom dissipation when water depth is less than depth_fw_cutoff.
